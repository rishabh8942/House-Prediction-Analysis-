## 📊 Project Highlights

### 🔍 Objectives

- Explore the dataset to identify trends, distributions, and outliers.
- Clean and preprocess data for machine learning tasks.
- Engineer new features such as house age and time since renovation.
- Visualize data with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Train a linear regression model using **only categorical features**.
- Evaluate the model using MAE and R-squared metrics.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Modeling and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**: Development environment

---

## 📈 Key Features Analyzed

- **MSZoning & LotConfig** – Impact of location on sale price
- **OverallCond** – Effect of house condition
- **TotalBsmtSF** – Correlation with basement size
- **YearRemodAdd** – Influence of renovations on value
- **HouseAge** – Effect of property age on price

---

## 📉 Predictive Modeling

A simple **Linear Regression** model was trained using:
- One-hot encoded categorical features
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared (R²) Score

---

## 📌 Insights

- Location and zoning significantly influence property value.
- Recently renovated homes tend to have higher sale prices.
- Basement size shows a strong positive correlation with price.
- A model based solely on categorical data can still provide meaningful predictions—though accuracy is limited.
